\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

% \note{At most 100 words describing the original aims of the project.}
The original aim was to write a compiler from a subset of OCaml to WebAssembly. I would perform type-inference, transform the typed AST through a series of intermediate representations, and generate a WebAssembly module which could be loaded in a browser such as Firefox. Possible extensions included expanding the OCaml subset, and implementing optimisations.


\section*{Work Completed}
%\note{At most 100 words summarising the work completed.}
I implemented a compiler consisting of type-inference, lambda-lifting, translation to an intermediate representation and WebAssembly code generation. I exceeded the success criteria by covering a larger subset of OCaml and by implementing a variety of optimisations. I implemented an end-to-end tester to automatically compile and test samples, and evaluated my compiler both in terms of the improvements made by optimisations and against other methods of executing OCaml.

% Assessors like to see some sample code or example circuit diagrams, and appendices are the sensible places to include such items. Accordingly, software and hardware projects should incorporate appropriate appendices. Note that the 12,000 word limit does not include material in the appendices, but only in extremely unusual circumstances may appendices exceed 10-15 pages - if you feel that such unusual circumstances might apply to you you should ask your Director of Studies and Supervisor to apply to the Chairman of Examiners. It is quite in order to have no appendices. Appendices should appear between the bibliography and the project proposal.

\chapter{Selected Code Samples}
\thispagestyle{headings}
This Appendix contains a few code samples for illustration: type inference and IR transformation of match blocks, and reaching definitions analysis.

\section{Type Inference of Match Blocks}
\label{sample:typematch}
This function is called by \textinline{infer_expr} when it encounters a match expression. A match expression consists of an expression (\textinline{expr}) and a list of cases (\textinline{cases}). The result of the expression is matched against each case's pattern --- so a constraint is generated to unify these types. In addition, the result of the whole match can only have one type. Thus we introduce a fresh type variable for this, and generate constraints that each case's expression must unify with this type.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{OCaml}
and infer_match state ctx expr cases =
  (* In general, variables names ending in 'cs' are constraint sets,
     and variable names ending in '_ast' are typed-AST elements *)
  let (ecs, e_ast) = infer_expr state ctx expr in
  let etyp = e_ast.texp_type in
  (* case list -> result type -> (constraints * tcase list) *)
  let rec handle_cases caselst rtyp =
    match caselst with
    | [] -> ([], [])  (* Run out of cases to consider *)
    | (case :: caselst') ->
        (* Infer the type of the case's pattern *)
        let (p_ast) = infer_pattern state ctx case.pc_lhs in
        let ptyp = p_ast.tpat_type in
        let vars = p_ast.tpat_vars in
        (* Create new context with the vars added by this pattern *)
        let ctx' = List.fold vars ~init:ctx ~f:(fun cx (v,t) ->
          Context.add_var cx v (Forall(Set.Poly.empty, t))
        ) in
        (* Use this context to check the case's expression *)
        let (ccs, c_ast) = infer_expr state ctx' case.pc_rhs in
        let ctyp = c_ast.texp_type in
        let (ccs', tc_lst) = handle_cases caselst' ctyp in
        let tcase = {
          tc_lhs = p_ast;
          tc_rhs = c_ast
        } in
        (* Add constraints case pattern's type = expression's type, and 
           case expression's type = incoming result type variable *)
        ((mk_uni(ptyp, etyp, expr.pexp_loc, "matchpat"))
          :: (mk_uni(rtyp, ctyp, expr.pexp_loc, "matchexpr")) :: (ccs @ ccs'),
          tcase :: tc_lst
        )
        (* Note constraints given names to ease with debugging *)
  in
  let restyp_var = fresh state in
  let restyp = (T_var(restyp_var)) in
  let (ccs, tc_lst) = handle_cases cases restyp in
  (* Merge expression and case constraints, emit result type and typed-AST *)
  (ecs @ ccs, restyp, Texp_match(e_ast, tc_lst))
\end{minted}

\section{Transformation of Match Blocks}
\label{sample:transformmatch}
This function is called by \textinline{transform_expr} when a match expression is encountered. As before, a match consists of an expression and cases, now in typed-AST form. \textinline{st_res_type} is the typed-AST result type of the match statement.
\\\\
First of all, we need to create the temporary variables and match block name. Then for each case, generate code for the pattern and expression, and code to copy the result of the case's expression to the result variable of the match statement. Each case is wrapped in a block to allow easy jumping to the end of the block (start of next case's block) if the case does not match.
\\\\
Instead of replacing the fail instruction in the pattern's code, the \textinline{transform_pat} function takes as an optional argument which instruction sequence to use on a fail --- in our case we pass in an instruction to jump out of the case block.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{OCaml}
and transform_match state st_res_typ expr cases =
  let (expr_var, expr_code) = transform_expr state expr in
  let result_type = stoitype st_res_typ in  (* Scheme type to intermediate type *)
  let result_var = update_vars state (Vars.add_temp_var state.vars result_type) in
  let match_block = update_vars state (Vars.add_block state.vars) in
  let inner_code = transform_list cases ~f:(fun case ->
    let case_block = update_vars state (Vars.add_block state.vars) in
    (* These instructions check and destructure the pattern *)
    let pat_code = transform_pat ~check:true ~escape:([Iins_exitblock(case_block)])
                                            state case.tc_lhs expr_var
    in
    (* Case expression, possibly using variables from the pattern *)
    let (matched_var, matched_code) = transform_expr state case.tc_rhs in
    let inside_block = pat_code @ matched_code @
                       [Iins_copyvar(result_type, result_var, matched_var);
                       Iins_exitblock(match_block)]
    in
      [Iins_startblock(case_block)]
    @ inside_block
    @ [Iins_endblock(case_block)]
  )
  in
  (result_var,
    expr_code
    @ [Iins_startblock(match_block)]
    @ inner_code
    @ [Iins_fail; (* No cases matching means no result, so we must fail *)
       Iins_endblock(match_block)]
  )

\end{minted}


\section{Reaching Definitions}
\label{sample:reach}
A data-flow analysis such as reaching definitions can be specified by a set of data-flow equations. For reaching definitions, these are as follows: (modified from \cite{Reaching_defs} )
\begin{align*}
\text{REACH}_{\text{in}} (i) \ = &\ \bigcup_{p \in \text{pred}(i)} \text{REACH}_\text{out} (p) \\
\text{REACH}_{\text{out}} (i) \ = &\ \big( \text{REACH}_\text{in} (i) - \text{kill}(i) \big) \cup \text{gen}(i) 
\end{align*}
For each instruction/line (there is one instruction per line), we have two sets. $\text{REACH}_\text{in}$ is the definitions which reach that instruction, while $\text{REACH}_\text{out}$ are these definitions modified by what occurs in that instruction. $\text{pred}(i)$ is the set of all instructions that can execute immediately before the instruction $i$. If an instruction (re)defines the variable $v$, then $\text{gen}(i)$ is the set containing only the pair $(v,i)$ signifying that $v$ is defined at line $i$, and $\text{kill}(i)$ is the set of all previous definitions of $v$.
\\\\
My implementation implements these data flow equations with some modifications. Initially, all REACH sets are initialized to empty. I then loop over basic blocks, and then the instructions inside them, applying these equations. This prevents having to compute a union for every instruction: instead, just the first instruction in each basic block needs to execute a set union. REACH sets such as \camlinline{in_defs} and \camlinline{out_defs} are mutable Hashtables: they map line numbers to immutable Maps, which in turn map variables to the set of lines where they could be defined. Mutable maps are useful where it is useful to have both old and new versions of the map, since all operations create a copy automatically.
\\\\
$\text{gen}(i)$ and $\text{kill}(i)$ are implemented simply by remapping the variable to a singleton set containing the new definition line only.
\\\\
My implementation is shown below:
\begin{minted}[linenos]{OCaml}
let reaching_definitions fa =
  (* Each argument var has a -1 definition corresponding to "from an argument" *)
  (* Map of arg var -> {-1} *)
  let start_func_defs = ... (* compute_start_func_defs fa *)

      let pred_defs = List.filter_map bb.bb_pred ~f:(fun pred_line ->
        let pred_bb = Map.find_exn fa.fa_basic_blocks pred_line in
        Hashtbl.find out_defs pred_bb.bb_end_line)
      in
      (* A map so we always have 1 predecessor map.
       * For the first basic block this is set to the start of func definitons *)
      let base_map =
        if bb.bb_start_line = 0 then
          start_func_defs
        else
          (Map.empty (module IVariable))
      in
      (* Union of predecessors *)
      let merged = List.reduce_exn (base_map :: pred_defs) ~f:(fun a b ->
        Map.merge_skewed a b ~combine:(fun ~key:_ s1 s2 -> Set.union s1 s2))
      in
      (* This is REACH_in for first line of the basic block, did it change? *)
      let old_defs_opt = Hashtbl.find in_defs bb.bb_start_line in
      let changed =
        match old_defs_opt with
        | Some(old_defs) -> not (Map.equal Set.equal old_defs merged)
        | None -> true
      in
      if changed then
        modified := true;
        (* Iterate over lines in the block *)
        Hashtbl.set in_defs ~key:bb.bb_start_line ~data:merged;
        for index = 0 to (Array.length bb.bb_code) - 1 do
          let line = bb.bb_start_line + index in
          let start_def = Hashtbl.find_exn in_defs line in
          (* Find the (optional) variable we assign to *)
          let assign_opt, _ = instr_vars (Array.get bb.bb_code index) in
          let end_def =
            match assign_opt with
            | Some(assign) ->
                (* Remap assign to the singleton set containing this line *)
                Map.set start_def ~key:assign ~data:(Int.Set.singleton line)
            | None ->
                start_def
